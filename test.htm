              I am on a mission of 1.2 million. Through my design skills, I am
              on a mission to transform our beautiful paradise island into an
              even better place to live for the 1.2 million people living in it.
              Is it even possible? Absolutely! By collaborating together on your
              exciting projects, we can revolutionise the way our island looks
              and functions, making our services and products more enjoyable and
              easily accessible for everyone. If you want to be another one of
              the 1.2 million to make the change, Join me!
